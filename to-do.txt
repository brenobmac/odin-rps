1 - Make a turn on/off function for buttons that turns buttons on when the DOM loads.
    After it loads we keep track of the number of roudns the player wants to play via a prompt.
    When round limit is reached, turn off buttons.
    Add a replay button that turns buttons back on and we ask again for how many rounds to play.
